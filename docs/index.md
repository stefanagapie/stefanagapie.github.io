Machine Learning Software Engineer
Brooklyn College - Part-time
Jan 2020 - May 2021
Brooklyn, NY 11210
  - Developed a multilayer perceptron (a.k.a deep neural network) model to map biomass components in algae; 
    under the supervision of distinguished computer science professor Theodore Raphan in collaboration with 
    professor Juergen Polle of the Department of Biology. I was tasked to build the algae model using Python 
    and TensorFlow, preprocess data using NumPy, generate plots using Matplotlib and prepare reports for 
    analysis.

Senior iOS Software Engineer 
Thomson Reuters - Full-time (Consultant)
Sep 2014 - Jun 2015
New York, NY 10036
  - Collaborate with an engineering team of five to deliver a, mobile first, personalized news service 
    application called Reuters TV. My primary tasks were to implement main app features like “Reuters Now” 
    and “Live Feeds.” UI element positioning was defined using Apple’s Auto Layout framework. The codebase is 
    comprised primarily of Objective-C. Most of the UI elements were programmatically implemented—NIB files 
    were sparingly used. My other tasks were to root out and fix software bugs and UI discrepancies.

Senior iOS Software Engineer
American Express - Full-time (Consultant)
Mar 2014 - Sep 2014
New York, NY 10007
  - Joined a team of four engineers to implement a partial code rewrite and a complete redesign of American 
    Express’s “Servicing” application. I worked on main app features like “Schedule Payments” and “Rewards.” 
    We used multiple Storyboard and XIB files to layout the various screen flows. All UILabels and related 
    views were coded to respond to accessibility text size changes; this task was automated using Auto Layout. 
    I used Xcode for building, debugging and testing of our Objective-C codebase. Some of my other 
    responsibilities involved performing rapid prototyping and assisting and mentoring junior developers.

Senior iOS Software Engineer
Condè Nast - Full-time
Feb 2013 - Mar 2014
New York, NY 10007
  - I worked with a team of five developers to implement a complete rewrites and redesign of two native iOS 
    applications: an iPhone only app called “Goings On” for the “The New Yorker” magazine, and an iPhone and 
    iPad app called Epicurious for a food and drinks magazine that goes by the same name. For Goings On I 
    architected and implemented an in-house audio player and audio file downloader—built on top of Apple's 
    Core Audio framework. This was part of an app feature called “Audio Tours.” On Epicurious I architected 
    and built the networking engine that was used throughout the app—built on top of apple's URL Loading 
    System. Another major feature that I worked on was “Search.” This feature communicated with two backend 
    services for drinks and food recipes and displayed the filtered results. The UI for both apps were 
    implemented with the use of Storyboards along with some XIB/NIB files. Auto Layout was used to controller 
    and/or define dynamic and static view content. Core Data was used for persistence.

iOS Software Engineer
VEVO - Full-time
Aug 2011 - Feb 2013
New York, NY 10036
  - Our Agile team of four developers, two of which were based on the West coast, collaborated on delivering 
    new features for VEVO’s existing iPad and iPhone music streaming video applications. When I arrived our 
    app analytics were reporting crashes that were affecting millions of users. I tracked down the source of 
    these crashes to bugs within our video player and corrected them. We went from about 6 million crashes per 
    month to just a few thousand. I also worked on features like “My Playlist;” a user interface for managing 
    multiple music video playlist that synced up with our web-based backend service.

Senior iOS Software Engineer
PAER - Full-time
Sep 2010 - Aug 2011
New York, NY 10005
  - As the sole full-time engineer, I helped this organization implement software for a mobile voting platform, 
    an iPad, that measures changes in user behavior when exposed to alternative voting methods for a particular 
    question. User responses were persisted using Core Data. I participated in a software development lifecycle 
    that included research, new development, modification, correction of errors, code reuse, re-engineering and 
    maintenance of this product.

Principal iOS Software Engineer
aGupieWare - Full-time
Apr 2008 - Sep 2010
Brooklyn, NY 11229
  - A company that I founded for the purpose of creating a portfolio of iOS applications to showcase to 
    potential employees. I built a set of five apps, two of which are universal builds that work with both iPad 
    and iPhone. With the CollageCAD app, a user may design there very own custom coloring pages. Or build their 
    own picture collage with custom shapes that they create; then fill them in with various colors, patterns or 
    images from their photo album and share via Twitter or Facebook. With the “Where Is My Car Parked?” app, a 
    user may save the geolocation of their vehicle where they last parked it and get directions back to it. 
    With the “New Year Noise Maker” app, a user will never again be caught on New Year’s Eve without a noise 
    maker. The app provides a set of noise makers, a pre-composed audio ensemble of all the noise makers and an 
    instrumental adaptation to the “Auld Lang Syne” poem. With the iDotsConnect app, a user embarks on a 
    mission, through hundreds of levels, to discover the shortest path between two dots on a graphs that I 
    designed with Photoshop.

  - Collaborate with a team to develop software that simulates or models both physical and abstract phenomenon 
    in a realtime, massively parallel multi-threaded GPGPU environment (data parallelism). My shared tasks 
    were to architect and program thread kernels for the NVIDA GPGPU chipsets that ran the simulations, test 
    software for correctness, debug issues and prepare summary along with an analysis of our findings.
